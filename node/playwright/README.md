# Beautylish Scrapers - Playwright (Node.js)

Extract high-quality beauty product data, reviews, and pricing from Beautylish using powerful Playwright automation in Node.js. These scrapers are designed to handle dynamic content and complex layouts efficiently, providing a robust solution for e-commerce data collection.

## Overview

This directory contains Node.js scrapers built with **Playwright**.

## Available Scrapers

- [Product Category](./product_category/README.md)
- [Product Data](./product_data/README.md)
- [Product Search](./product_search/README.md)

## Why Playwright?

Playwright is a modern, high-performance browser automation library that offers several advantages for scraping sophisticated e-commerce platforms like Beautylish:

- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Unlike static HTML parsers, Playwright executes JavaScript, allowing it to scrape content that is rendered dynamically or requires user interaction.
- **Auto-Wait Functionality**: Playwright automatically waits for elements to be actionable, significantly reducing flakiness caused by slow-loading network requests or animations.
- **Headless Performance**: It supports fast, headless execution across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, ensuring your scrapers are both versatile and efficient.
- **Context Isolation**: Playwright's "Browser Contexts" allow for clean sessions without the overhead of launching multiple browser instances, saving memory and CPU.
- **Resilience**: With built-in support for intercepting network requests and handling modern web features like Shadow DOM, it is ideal for bypassing common frontend hurdles.

Playwright is the recommended choice when you need a reliable, "real-user" simulation to ensure data accuracy on sites with complex client-side logic.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Node.js 14 or higher
- **npm**: npm
- **ScrapeOps API Key**: For anti-bot protection (free tier available)

## Installation

1. Navigate to the specific scraper directory:
```bash
cd product_category  # or product_data, product_search
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install playwright cheerio
```

3. Get your ScrapeOps API key from [https://scrapeops.io/app/register/ai-scraper](https://scrapeops.io/app/register/ai-scraper)

4. Update the API key in the scraper file:
```node
API_KEY = 'YOUR-API-KEY'
```

## Anti-Bot Protection

All scrapers can integrate with **ScrapeOps** to help handle Beautylish's anti-bot measures:
- Proxy rotation (may help reduce IP blocking)
- Request header optimization (can help reduce detection)
- Rate limiting management

**Note**: Anti-bot measures vary by site and may change over time. CAPTCHA challenges may occur and cannot be guaranteed to be resolved automatically. Using proxies and browser automation can help reduce blocking, but effectiveness depends on the target site's specific anti-bot measures.

**Free Tier Available**: ScrapeOps offers a generous free tier perfect for testing and small-scale scraping.

## Output Format

All scrapers output data in **JSONL format** (one JSON object per line):
- Each line represents one product/result
- Efficient for large datasets
- Easy to process line-by-line
- Can be imported into databases or data processing tools

Example output files:
- `beautylish_com_product_category_page_scraper_data_20260114_120000.jsonl`
- `beautylish_com_product_page_scraper_data_20260114_120000.jsonl`
